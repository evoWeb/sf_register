Introduction
============

This Documentation was written for version 2.0.0 of the extension.


What does it do?
----------------


Registration with admin review and all notifications:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a new user fills in the registration form they will see the
strength of their password, along with additional email address
and password fields to ensure they are filled in correctly.

Upon submitting the form, the user will have their data presented
to them for review, just in case they want to change something.
If the user submits again, the data is then stored in the database
with a temporary usergroup. Any uploaded pictures are stored in a
temporary folder until the user is activated.

The user is then sent an email with a link to verify their email address.
The website administrator also receives an email to notify them that
a new user has registered.

Once the user has verified their email address, the admin will be sent
another notification, but this time containing an activation link.
If the admin decides to accept the new user, they can click the link
which will then update the database and set a regular usergroup for
that user's account. One final email notification is sent to the user
to inform them that their account is now active.

The new user will be able to log in and see all the pages and content
that their usergroup permits!
